Prototype application launcher

TODO:

1) ~~Make it work with all icons (should be done)~~

2. ~~If the right sized png exists, then use that, otherwise rasterize it (a bit janky but it works)~~
3. ~~Use XDG_CACHE_DIR to rasterize svgs (done)~~
4. Make sure it's using the current icon theme
5. Design a better app launcher ui
